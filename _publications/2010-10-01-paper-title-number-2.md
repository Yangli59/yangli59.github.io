excerpt: 'This study investigates the gating mechanism of ATP permeation in Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1), a voltage- and Ca2+-gated ATP channel critical for neuronal signaling. Using cryo-EM, the authors resolved structures of Danio rerio CALHM1 heptamers and an octamer in ATP-nonconducting states, with resolutions ranging from 2.9 Å to 3.5 Å. Structural analysis reveals a central pore diameter of approximately 6.6 Å in the heptameric CALHM1, with the N-helix positioned to avoid steric clashes. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the transition of the N-helix from the “down” to the “up” position significantly increases the pore size for ATP permeation. These findings offer crucial insights into the ATP gating mechanism of CALHM1.'

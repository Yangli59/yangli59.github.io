title: "The full activation mechamism of adenosine A1 receptor revealed by GaMD and supervised GaMD (Su-GaMD) simulations."
collection: publications
permalink: 'https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2203702119'
excerpt: 'This study presents the development of a novel molecular dynamics simulation approach called supervised Gaussian accelerated MD (Su-GaMD), which successfully simulates the full activation mechanism of the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) within hundreds of nanoseconds. By revealing the recognition pathways of both the agonist and G protein to the G proteinâ€“coupled receptor (GPCR), this research provides valuable structural insights into A1R, potentially advancing drug discovery efforts for targeting this receptor.'

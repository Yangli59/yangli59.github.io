excerpt: 'This study reveals the cryo-electron microscopic structure of human TACAN (hTACAN), an ion channel-like protein potentially involved in sensing mechanical pain. hTACAN forms a dimer, with each protomer consisting of a transmembrane globular domain (TMD) and an intracellular domain (ICD). Molecular dynamics simulations indicate the presence of a putative ion conduction pore in each protomer. A single-point mutation at Met207 significantly increases membrane pressure-activated currents, and each hTACAN subunit binds one cholesterol molecule. These findings provide insights into the molecular assembly of hTACAN, suggesting that the wild-type protein is in a closed state.'

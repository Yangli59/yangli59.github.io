excerpt: 'This study presents the discovery of novel A1 adenosine receptor (A1AR) antagonists using a multistage virtual screening approach. By screening the ChemDiv library of 1,492,362 compounds, the researchers identified 22 potential hits, with 18 exhibiting nanomolar or low micromolar binding potency (Ki) in radioligand binding assays. Six compounds were further tested in a cAMP functional assay, revealing low micromolar antagonistic activity (pIC50 = 5.51–6.38) for A1AR. Notably, four compounds demonstrated high affinity (pKi = 6.11–7.13) and selectivity (>100-fold) for A1AR over A2AAR. Novelty analysis confirmed the uniqueness of these antagonists. Molecular docking and MD simulations supported the stability and specificity of the top three compounds (15, 20, 22) in the A1AR binding pocket, providing valuable insights for the development of A1AR-targeted drugs.'

excerpt: 'This study elucidates the mechanism of Mg2+ permeation through Mitochondrial RNA splicing 2 (Mrs2), a eukaryotic CorA ortholog, by presenting four cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Homo sapiens Mrs2 (hMrs2) under various conditions. The hMrs2 structures reveal symmetrical pentamers with a unique Cl−-bound R-ring formed by five Arg332 residues. Molecular dynamics simulations and mitochondrial Mg2+ uptake assays suggest that the R-ring acts as a charge repulsion barrier, while Cl− functions as a ferry to facilitate Mg2+ permeation, driven by the membrane potential. These findings provide significant insights into the channel assembly and function of hMrs2.'

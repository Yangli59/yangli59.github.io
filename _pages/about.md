I'm Yang Li, a researcher at [GHDDI](http://www.ghddi.org/). I earned my Ph.D. under the guidance of Prof. Lin at the [College of Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/). Following that, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a postdoctoral fellow under Prof. Shen at the [College of Life Science](https://sky.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/).

My work focuses on computer-aided drug design, using molecular simulations, artificial intelligence, and computational biology to study key target molecules. By combining these techniques with chemical and biological experiments, I aim to speed up the discovery of new drugs.

With over 10 research articles and reviews published, my expertise is in multiscale molecular dynamics simulations of biological systems, and I have developed new algorithms to explore how molecules recognize each other.

I'm always happy to share my work and discoveries. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss molecular dynamics, AI in drug design, or related topics.

I'm Yang Li, a researcher at GHDDI. I earned my Ph.D. under the guidance of Prof. Lin at the [College of Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/). Following that, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a postdoctoral fellow under Prof. Shen at the [College of Life Science](https://sky.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/).

Dedicated to computer-aided drug design and applied research, my work focuses on molecular simulations, artificial intelligence, and computational biology to uncover the secrets of key target molecules. By combining these techniques with chemical and biological experiments, the goal is to accelerate the discovery of new drug molecules.

With over 10 research articles and reviews published, my expertise shines in multiscale molecular dynamics simulations of biological systems. I've also developed new MD algorithms with enhanced sampling to explore the mechanisms behind molecular recognition processes.

Always excited to share my journey and discoveries, I'm open to discussions about molecular dynamics, AI in drug design, or any related topic. Feel free to reach out.
